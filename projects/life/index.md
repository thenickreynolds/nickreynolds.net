This is a JavaScript + Canvas implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). This is a very small "game" I wrote to play around with the design that could be used for the future [Wall Art project](../living) as well as having a quick spin with Canvas and test the speeds of different browsers.

The game features a few different options for map dimensions, tile size, updating frequency, and allows the user to manually toggle the state of a tile (mouse click).
