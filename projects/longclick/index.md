title: Long Click, New Tab
---

After purchasing a new laptop without physical mouse buttons I was quickly frustrated by the fact I couldn't middle click in a browser to open links in a new tab.

To improve my experience browsing the web I decided to write a new Google Extension. I approach the problem in multiple ways and tested for usability and speed, finally I settled on allowing users to click and hold the mouse button down on links within the browser for ½ second - this will open the link in the background in an adjacent tab.

I uploaded this to the Chrome Web Store to allow other users to enjoy the same functionality and, more greedily, to have it automatically install on all my machines.
