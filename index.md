Welcome

I'm located in San Francisco, California working for Airbnb. I am the
Engineering Manager for multiple teams within Host Growth, responsible for driving
increased supply growth to meet Airbnb's demand.

This interview is with Microsoftâ€™s Channel 9 when I was the tech lead and acting PM
for Facebook Messenger for Windows Phone - with a reach of 10M+ MAU.
